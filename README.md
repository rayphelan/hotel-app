# Hotel Manager

This is a basic Hotel Manager app which provides basic functionality for managing Bookings, Customers, Rooms, Room Types and Services. The app can be further developed to cater for functions such as User Login, Promotions, Searches, etc. The app initializes with only one full-page HTTP request, and all other requests are handled by Ajax, which means the main index page can contain CSS animations that will not be interupted by HTTP requests.
